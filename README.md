# ExploratoryDataProject1
First Project in Exploratory Data Analysis
This project contains 4 png files named plot1.png,plot2.png,plot3.png and plot4.png
It also contains the 4 r program classes plot1.r,plot2.r,plot3.r and plot4.r which generated these 4 pngs
each class repeats the initial reading and filtering of the file although in a real project that phase would probably be separated out into the getting data and the tidying phase
Data set
I captured the whole data set but then filtered on Feb 1 and 2 of 2007 to make the data set smaller so that I did not have to filter repeatedly later on.  
The r classes are commented to hopefully make them easy to read by the reviewer.   Although I thought of improved techniques to make this easier in the future, I left my ini in the table
